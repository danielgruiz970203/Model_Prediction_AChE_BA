# Model_Prediction_AChE_BA

This is the prediction Model of Acetylcholinesterase biological activity.
I try to test different algorithms to predict and analyze important
characteristics in the classificator models like sensitivity, selectivity and accuracy using the confusion matrix.

Initialy i did the project using a Jupyter notebook and i am going to try to improve different predictions methods.

The data base was downloaded using "Bindig Database" and "ChEMBL".

The molecular descriptors was calculated using the software ALvaDesc 2.0 with a trial license of 1 month but i'll try
to use PaDEL descriptors and the tools of libraries like mordred and RDKit.

I was created a gap of 1.5  units of pIC50 such as separation of active and inactive molecules starting with 6,75 (Active) and  <5,25 (Inactive).
for the Homo Sapiens models.

Thank you for reading I'll wait for your recomendations.
