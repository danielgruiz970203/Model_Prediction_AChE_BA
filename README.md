# Model_Prediction_AChE_BA

This is the prediction Model of Acetylcholinesterase biological activity.
I try to test different algorithms to predict and analyze important
characteristics in the classificator models like sensitivity, selectivity and accuracy using the confusion matrix.

Initialy i did the project using a Jupyter notebook and i am going to try to improve different predictions methodos.

The data base was downloaded using "Bindig Database".

The molecular descriptors was calculated using the software ALvaDesc 2.0 with a trial license of 1 month but i'll try
to use PaDEL descriptors.

<<<<<<< HEAD
I was created a gap of 2.7  units of pIC50 such as separation of active and inactive molecules starting with >7.2 (Active) and  <4.5 (Inactive).

Thank you for reading I'll wait for your recomendations.
